## Palette Pro
This program allows you to create stunning 16-color paint palettes with matching light and dark variants for each color. 

With just a few clicks, you can generate randomized color combinations and save them as beautifully crafted 320x60 PNG grids. It's the perfect tool for designers, artists, and anyone who loves to experiment with colors.

This selected the 42 most used colors, determined algorithmically with a slight variation added, meaning, each time it's used on a single image will generate slightly different results.

## Select Color
By selecting the first color you set the tone for the rest of the 15 colors and their varients.

*There is random logic to all the colors, if you select the same color twice you will get a different color palette.*
